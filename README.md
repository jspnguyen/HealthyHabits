# Healthy Habits

## Summary

Healthy Habits is an in-browser AI tool that leverages OpenCV and HumeAI to capture facial expressions and derive scores for a wide range of emotions. The emotional data is temporarily stored and used to judge when users need to take a break during a work session. Anyone can have the website run in the background as a tab and do their work as normal. Whenever their negative emotions peak over the threshold, a sound is played which notifies the user that they should take a break. Additionally, users can request reports on each recording session which are processed through OpenAI and emailed directly to the user.
